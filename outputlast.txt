The beatles were an english rock band that formed in liverpool, in 1960. With john lennon, paul mccartney, george harrison and ringo starr, they became widely regarded as the greatest and most influential act of the rock era.[1] Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, the beatles later experimented with several genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as "beatlemania", but as their songwriting grew in sophistication they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions.

From 1960, the beatles built their reputation playing clubs in liverpool and hamburg over a three-year period. Manager brian epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer george martin enhanced their musical potential. They gained popularity in the united kingdom after their first hit, "love me do", in late 1962. They acquired the nickname "the fab four" as beatlemania grew in britain over the following year, and by early 1964 they had become international stars, leading the "british invasion" of the united states pop market. From 1965 onwards, the beatles produced what many critics consider their finest material, including the innovative and widely influential albums rubber soul (1965), revolver (1966), sgt. Pepper's lonely hearts club band (1967), the beatles ("the white album", 1968) and abbey road (1969). After their break-up in 1970, they each enjoyed successful musical careers. Lennon was shot and killed in december 1980, and harrison died of lung cancer in november 2001. Mccartney and starr, the surviving members, remain musically active
